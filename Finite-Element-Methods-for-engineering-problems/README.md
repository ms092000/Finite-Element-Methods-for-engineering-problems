# Finite-Element-Methods-for-engineering-problems
This repository contains all the codes that I made to solve my assignments for a online course for FEM for engineering problems. I have solved problems of various dimensions and orders with multiple triangulation procedures. The comments in each code file  have more information and all code in in C/C++.
